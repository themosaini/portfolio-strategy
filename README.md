Multi-Asset Portfolio Strategies built using Python Libraries

Here's what each graph signifies:

Equal Weighted Portfolio: This graph shows the performance of a portfolio where each asset is given an equal weight, meaning the same amount of investment is allocated to each asset. The plotted line represents the cumulative returns of the portfolio over the specified time period. It helps visualise how the portfolio composed of equally weighted assets performs compared to other strategies.
Market Cap Weighted Portfolio: This graph shows the performance of a portfolio where the weights of assets are determined based on their market capitalisation. Assets with higher market capitalisation have a larger weight in the portfolio compared to assets with lower market capitalisation. The plotted line represents the cumulative returns of the portfolio over time, reflecting the performance of this market-cap-weighted strategy.
Minimum Variance Portfolio: This graph shows the performance of a portfolio constructed to minimise portfolio variance or volatility. The weights of assets in this portfolio are determined to minimise the overall risk of the portfolio while achieving the desired level of return. The plotted line represents the cumulative returns of the portfolio over time, illustrating the performance of this risk-optimised strategy.
Each plotted graph provides insight into how different portfolio construction strategies perform over time, allowing investors to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving investment objectives and managing risk. If the desired results from the strategy are not achieved, the parameters in the portfolio such as weights assigned, volume etc. can be set accordingly.

Using the same strategies, you can include a portfolio of as many assets as you usually trade with having a low or negative correlation with each other.

Including assets with low correlation can help reduce portfolio risk while potentially enhancing returns. The specific assets included in an efficient portfolio depend on various factors such as investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and market conditions.
